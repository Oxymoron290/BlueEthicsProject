In this report I would like to include the year(s) the candidates were on the ballot, and if they were elected, re-elected or lost. In addition I would like to include the name, sex, ethnicity, place/title, and dates served in office in this report. I am also requesting the reason for their term ending, weather they were voted out, resigned, was recalled/dismissed, became ineligible (reached maximum term, convicted of a felony, moved out of the city), or otherwise. I understand that if I seek a copy of these records, there may be a copying fee. Please inform me of that cost prior to making the copy with an itemized detailed quote. When determining the charge for this request, please consider that the information being requested will be distributed to the benefit of the general public(552.267). I can be reached at [PHONE NUMBER] or at [EMAIL ADDRESS].
