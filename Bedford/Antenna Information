Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, Chapter 552 of the Texas Government Code, I am formally requesting information regarding antennas installed on the Water Tower located at Bedford Fire Station #3 in Bedford, TX.

Specifically, I am seeking a comprehensive report that includes, but is not limited to, the following details about each antenna:

Technical Details:
Model number for the antenna.
Identification number for the antenna - how the antenna is identified on the water tower.
Frequency Range: Understand the exact frequency range the antenna operates in, beyond just usable frequencies.
Bandwidth: The range of frequencies over which the antenna can operate effectively.
Polarization: The orientation in which the antenna radiates – either horizontal, vertical, or circular.
Gain: The amount of signal increase (or amplification) the antenna provides, usually measured in dBi (decibels relative to an isotropic radiator).
Radiation Pattern: How the antenna distributes the signal in space. This can be important in understanding interference patterns.
Type: The specific kind of antenna (e.g., dipole, monopole, Yagi, dish, etc.).
Protocols: standards or systems utilizing the antenna.
Feed Point Impedance: Helps understand how efficiently the antenna can be matched to its transmission line.
VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio): A measure of how well the antenna impedance matches the feed line impedance.

Administrative & Operational Details:
Owner/Installer of the antenna.
Date of Installation.
Date of the last inspection or maintenance.
Permit number or any associated authorization codes.
Purpose: Why the antenna was installed – e.g., for cellular service, emergency services, broadcasting, etc.
Lease or Ownership Arrangements: Understand if the space is leased, and if so, the terms and duration of any agreements.
Contact Information: A point of contact related to each antenna, for any operational or maintenance queries.
Previous Maintenance Issues: Any historical issues or repairs that might have been required.
Interference Reports: Any recorded incidents of the antenna causing interference with other systems.
Power Source: How the antenna (or its related equipment) is powered.
Back-up Systems: Any secondary systems in place should the primary system fail.
Operational Uptime: Percentage of time the antenna is operational versus downtime for maintenance or other issues.

Safety & Compliance:
Emission Levels: Measurement of the antenna's radiation to ensure it is within safe limits, especially if near populated areas.
Safety Precautions: Any specific precautions or safety zones established around the antenna.
Compliance Certificates: Documents that show the antenna meets local, state, and federal regulations.
Insurance & Liability Coverage: Details about any insurance coverage related to the antenna, especially if there's potential harm or interference to others.

I understand that if I seek a copy of these records, there may be a copying fee. Please inform me of that cost prior to making the copy with an itemized detailed quote. When determining the charge for this request, please consider that the information being requested will be distributed to the benefit of the general public(552.267). I can be reached at (972) 375 4431 or at timothysturm6@gmail.com.

If some parts of this request are easier to fulfill than others, I kindly ask that you release any accessible records as they become available. Please provide the records in digital format if possible; if not, paper copies will suffice.

If access to the records I requested is going to take longer than 14 business days, please contact me so we can work out a reasonable delivery.
If you choose to deny the request in whole or in part, then you are required to respond in writing and state the statutory exception authorizing the withholding of all or part of the public record and the name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial.
