## Getting Started

The first step is to contact the city secretary or the county courthouse to learn the following:

After contacting the city secretary or the county courthouse to determine how to request information under Texas Government Code 552, the following message can be sent:

```
Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act (Texas Government Code, Chapter 552), I would like to obtain copies of the following public records:
I am requesting a roster of all current and former law enforcement officers, public service officers and deputies who have been associated with the [LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY] since January 2019. In this report I would like to include the name, sex, ethnicity, salary, title, division, and dates of employment. In addition, I am requesting all complaints and disciplinary records closed or pending for the same time period. This request includes all divisions of the [LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY], including CID, Courts, or Animal services. I understand that if I seek a copy of these records, there may be a copying fee. Please inform me of that cost prior to making the copy with an itemized detailed quote. When determining the charge for this request, please consider that the information being requested will be distributed to the benefit of the general public(552.267). I can be reached at [PHONE NUMBER] or at [EMAIL ADDRESS].
If access to the records I requested is going to take longer than 14 business days, please contact me so we can work out a reasonable delivery.
If you choose to deny the request in whole or in part, then you are required to respond in writing and state the statutory exception authorizing the withholding of all or part of the public record and the name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial.
