# Blue Ethics Project

By utilizing a multi-faceted approach, including the analysis of complaints sustained and not sustained against law enforcement officers, and conducting in-depth investigations into cases of officer misconduct, this research project seeks to identify the root causes and contributing factors of such behavior. Through this analysis, the project aims to propose effective solutions for accountability and reform within law enforcement agencies, with the goal of promoting trust and legitimacy between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
